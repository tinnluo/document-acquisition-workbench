"""LangGraph StateGraph for the document acquisition workflow.

Two graph variants are provided:

- **discover graph** (used by ``discover --engine langgraph``):
      discover → followup → rank → END
  Stops after ranking; does *not* run ``review_prep``.  The ``discover``
  command only writes discovery artefacts, so running ``review_prep`` would
  be wasted work and would emit misleading review-stage telemetry.

- **review graph** (used internally when a full pipeline is needed):
      discover → followup → rank → review_prep → END

Usage

    ----------
